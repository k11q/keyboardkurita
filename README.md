hai! nak share my latest side project, been building this for ~3 days it's *working* now.

a keyboard practice app. why another keyboard practice app lepas dah ada beribu available?

pertama, I type very slow, and as I explore most of the apps doesnt have the thing that I need, tbh, I dont search that many, prob less than 10 and I only stayed with keybr. here are several of them:

- Easily pick a character to train and all the words must contain the character. I just found one that able to does it, keybr doesnt have it, monkeytype taktau, banyak memang pening nak navigate.

- Continuous/uninterrupted practice. Keybr does this best. monkeytype setiap kali lepas train dia keluar analytics tu, taktau ada setting ke apa nak bagi boleh train non-stop.

- Data-based learning. Maknanya the app would suggest best words to fit you for you to improve. This is what I'm trying to achieve.

3 problem diatas I can say mine *works* currently. Other than that, I just think it would be a fun project because it involves data where I can try to build an algorithm that provides the most effective learning, not just frontend. Other goal is for this to be more app to be more social, and I really want to try learn machine learning to build my own GPT to generate the text for the effective learning algo.

Anyone interested in this project feel free to contact me, this is open source project and the app will be 100% free to build and free to use, fork it do whatevery you want, BIG DISCLAIMER I think currently the app contains the most shit code I've ever seen. I didnt take a single second to clean it up the whole time I'm building it, most of the time I dont know what Im doing so I didnt structure it or anything.
